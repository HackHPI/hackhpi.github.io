# HackHPI Website
Current status: WIP.

#### Local development
Since GitHub Pages deploys the website using Jekyll, it's probably best to use that in your local environment as well.

`gem install jekyll bundler` to install Jekyll once on your machine
`cd` into root directory
`jekyll serve`
go to `localhost:4000` in your browser
