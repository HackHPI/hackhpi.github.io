        A functioning government is crucial for ensuring efficient public
        services. It is necessary that government agencies adapt their
        infrastructure and used technologies to the increasingly digitized
        society to effectively serve their citizens.

        In today's world, where sensitive information and critical
        infrastructure are increasingly connected to the internet, it is
        essential that government agencies and institutions are protected
        against cyber threats.

        However, as many people experience every day, in the field of
        digitalization, government and public institutions are still lagging
        behind. This year is about developing secure solutions that can help to
        improve and democratize these areas.
