					<h3>#1 Capturing Your Environmental Footprint</h3>

					<p>With more than 90.000 employees, SAP’s quest to fulfill the <a href="https://sap.com/unglobalgoals" target="_blank">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a>
						cannot be completed unless everybody does their part. But how does an employee really know their environmental footprint
						(Goals 7, 11, and 13)? How can they share all the good deeds they have and done and continue to do?&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Your challenge is to create a solution that enables SAP employees to capture their environmental impact while commuting,
						at work, or on business trips. You are free to focus on either implicit (through sensors, usage data, etc.) or explicit
						(e.g., logging shared car rides with colleagues, logging elevator rides) data collection. For either case, the manual
						effort for employees should be kept to a minimum, but still yield complete and meaningful data.</p>

					<h3>#2 Offset Your Browsing Emissions</h3>

					<p>Beyond the immediate cost of energy consumed by your Smartphone, Notebook, TV, etc., there’s a hidden impact on the environment that originates from the servers answering your requests.</p>
					<p>Your task is to allow users to easily offset their emissions caused by visiting popular websites (by purchasing CO2 compensation certificates, donating money to environmental organizations, etc.). As the focus is more on finding innovative and user-friendly ways of offsetting emissions, feel free to use rough estimates for CO2 emissions / energy consumption caused by using popular web sites (e.g., <a href="https://inhabitat.com/infographic-how-much-energy-does-google-use/">0,0003kwh per google search</a>, a bit less for viewing a static html page etc.).</p>
					<p>A different aspect of this topic is to replace the emission estimate with concrete numbers based on software components involved in serving user requests. Your task is to provide a server component (e.g., monitoring CPU utilization during process execution) solution to estimating the energy consumption of different IT services involved in serving user requests.</p>

					<h3>#1 How can we make climate change more tangible?</h3>

					<p><i>Option 1:</i><br>The climate crisis is no far off phenomena, it has reached our homes. Its consequences, for example extreme weather
						events like heavy rain and heatwaves, is affecting the nature just outside our front doors. Growth patterns of plants
						and crops change just like behavioural patterns of animals such as migratory birds. Some plants and animals cannot
						cope with the changing environment, they disappear altogether.</p>

					<p>We want people not only to open their eyes to these changes. We want them to share their observations with others, building
						a network of locally engaged citizens who connect over the discussion of climate change in their region. Ideally, we
						want them to become active in the fight against climate change.</p>

					<p><i>Option 2:</i><br>Not only the consequences of climate change can be seen and felt right here, where we live. One of the main causes for the crisis is a neighbour to many people: coal power plants. Their emissions fuel global warming and threaten our health. We want people to see where coal power plants are located relative to their own location and be able to track the level of emissions from these plants.</p>

					<p>If the emissions exceed a certain threshold, the tracking should combine a call for action, e.g. provide a template letter to be sent to the local politician/the company owning the power plant demanding changes in order to protect the people’s health and the health of our planet. An alternative call to action could focus on individual lifestyle choices.</p>

					<h3>#2 How can we get people to turn the tide on plastic?</h3>

					<p>The world is addicted to plastic and this addiction is an immense threat to the environment, especially to the oceans and its creatures. As our plastic consumption is set to skyrocket, it’s clear that urgent action is needed. We need to wean ourselves off single use plastic items like coffee cups, plastic cutlery oder take away food packaging that is only used for a couple of minutes before being thrown away.</p>

					<p>We also need businesses to take the issue seriously – whether it’s supermarkets having a plastic free aisle and offering items free of packaging whereever possible, companies finding alternatives to non recycable plastic packaging or restaurants, hotels and canteens encouraging people to bring their own food containers for drinks and take away food instead of giving out single use plastic containers. Political action is required as well: We need goals and rules for more recycling and less single use plastic.</p>

					<p>We want people to not only make individual lifestyle changes and ditch unnecessary plastic wherever possible, we want them to act as advocates for a broader change. We want them to motivate businesses as well as politicians to take the necessary actions. We need a global movement to turn the tide on plastic.</p>

					<h3>#1 Use and waste of freshwater resources in the EU</h3>
					<p style="margin-top: 0">In cooperation with European Environment Agency</p>

					<p>Despite freshwater being a renewable resources the amount of renewable water resources declined by 24% between 1960 and 2010. With less freshwater supply the water quality suffers and in some cases the groundwater, if completely depleted, is replaced by salt water. The data provided gives an indication about the biggest fresh water consumers. The goal is to identify these consumers, find relations and create a roadmap for a more sustainable way of using freshwater resources.</p>

					<h3>#2 Rail temperature change due to climate change?</h3>
					<p style="margin-top: 0">In cooperation with DB Netze</p>

					<p>Railways are built with an average temperature of 23,5 °C +/-5 °C in mind. If the rail gets too hot or too cold the risk of damaging the rail increases. Therefore DB Netze, a part of the Deutsche Bahn AG, introduced sensors to measure the temperature at the rail and in the air. The data contains these temperatures for the last 2 years for a couple of locations. The goals is to identify circumstances when the rail temperature exceeds certain thresholds, correlate the rail temperature with the UV index or other meteorological KPIs and develop recommendations and predictions about the future rail temperature development.</p>

					<h3>#1 Human insights in image segmentation</h3>

					<p>Segmentation of multiple co-located Earth imagery is fundamental to identify ground units potentially exhibiting different
						characteristics in dynamic processes in our environment. Technical sensor systems, e.g., satellites, image the ground objectively
						with limited resolution and limited measurement accuracy that can be estimated or quantified. Human experts map visible
						features at the earth’s surface, e.g., geology, to the best of their skills and provide categorical/classified images of
						the area without trustworthiness quantification.</p>

					<p>Your challenge is to integrate human and technically sensed images into one segmented image paying attention to the data
						trustworthiness.</p>

					<h3>#2 Causal inference on hydrological droughts</h3>

					<p>Prolonged period of below-normal precipitation cause deficiencies in water supply, as measured by below-normal streamflow,
						lake and reservoir levels, groundwater levels, and depleted soil moisture content. These deficiencies are called droughts.
						A drought is complex phenomenon which is difficult to monitor and define. It is a creeping phenomenon that slowly sneaks
						up and impacts many sectors of the economy, and operates on many different time scales. Therefore, identification of
						factors that control hydrological droughts is essential for mitigation and adaptation measures.</p>

					<p>Your challenge is to use data-driven techniques to identify these controlling factors in a modelled data product. Covariates
						include all relevant physiographic, land cover, and climatic characteristics. In order to gain insight on the influence
						of pre-event conditions, time-lags are included for the dynamic covariates e.g. precipitation, soil moisture, temperature
						and snow pack.</p>

					<h3>#1 Machine learning to stabilize the climate and reach sustainable development goals</h3>

					<p>Machine learning has recently been used to solve challenging problems in complex environments, for example acquiring super-human skill in the game of Go and vintage Atari games. We challenge you to interact with a social-ecological climate game powered by state-of-the-art Earth system science via a Python API. Use machine learning techniques (e.g. reinforcement learning, deep neural networks, evolutionary algorithms) to find strategies to successfully both stabilize the climate and reach sustainable development goals.</p>

					<h3>#2 Visualization of high-dimensional Earth system model outputs with respect to planetary boundaries</h3>

					<p>The outputs of state-of the-art Earth system models are high-dimensional and hard to grasp and understand intuitively. We challenge you to create appealing animated visualizations of high-dimensional time trajectories generated by complex Earth system models. You may use dimensionality reduction and related techniques to display the key features of high-dimensional system states and time evolution. Put a particular emphasis on showing how close trajectories are to critical planetary boundaries that should not be crossed (for example those related to global warming) for sustainable development to be feasible.</p>
